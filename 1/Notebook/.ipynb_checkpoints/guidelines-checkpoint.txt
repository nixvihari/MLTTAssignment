Using either the housing dataset (refer chapter-2): 

Create a single pipeline that does the full data preparation plus the final prediction.
Try replacing GridSearchCV with RandomizedSearchCV. 
Try adding a transformer in the preparation pipeline to select only the most important attributes.

Look at the different variables to see how it affects churn //correlation

Run cluster analysis
Profile the different Clusters //cluster centers, density, cross cluster comparitions, size comparisions.
